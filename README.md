- Fighting Game Prototype
	- Features
		- The player character is placed onto a stage with a sandbag, on the opposite end. 
			- The player can move using the arrow keys. 
            - The player can punch the sandbag by pressing or holding the key "A".
            - If the player falls off the stage, they disappear from the map.  
		- If the sandbag is hit 4 times, it is destroyed and disappears.
		- This game prototype somewhat functions like the home-run context in Smash Brothers.
		- Both the player and the sandbag have sprites and animations drawn by me. 
	- Difficulties 
		- I had difficulties at first in understanding how to use Git.  
	- What I learned 
		- I've learned the fundamentals of Godot and Git
	- What I enjoyed 
		- I found using Godot to make a game like this to be very fun, and I will probably continue making games with Godot in the future. 
			- (Thank you for recommending that I use Godot instead of Pygame)
