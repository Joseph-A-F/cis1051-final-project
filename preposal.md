# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- Create a prototype Smash Brothers like fighting game using Pygame 
- Create a Graphical to-do list and note-taking app similar to Google Keep and Todoist.
- Create a artist pose exercise app that gives the user a reference photo to draw for a timed interval. 
- Create a blender plugin that automates or simplifies some elements of Blender. 
  - Allowing users to save presets of render settings from another project to be used in another.
  - Automatically scrubbing video reference objects so they start at the timestamp the user is currently looking at.
  - Automatically saving image sequence renders in its own folder, and allowing users to resume rendering where they left off if Blender crashes or if the user pauses the render. 
- A pomodoro timer

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

- None 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

- Do you believe these some of these ideas are too ambitious given the time we have to work on this project?
