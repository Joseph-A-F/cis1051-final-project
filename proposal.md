# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

### Fighting game prototype 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A fighting game prototype with an ai opponent. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will place the user in a Smash Bros-like stage that includes an simple AI opponent. There will either be one or more characters the user can choose. I will use Object-Oriented Programming for the player characters and opponent.  All of this will be run under the python package, Pygame.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The minimum I would like to accomplish is most of the player mechanics including collisions and jumping. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would have the Player's attacks added along with an Opponent that just stands there as a test dummy for the Player.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

What I hope to accomplish by the end of the project's deadline is a prototype that is more game than a test demo, with a working AI opponent. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
